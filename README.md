# fnf - lumen engine

a fork of p-slice engine that attempts to be more modular and easier to script outside of songs with

why did i make this? i just thought p-slice was a bit too hardcoding-oriented, also i wanted it to have scripting capabilities akin to emi3's psych fork that let you script outside of songs, and also have a more modular structure that allows you to easily add new features without having to edit the engine itself

essentially a crossover between psych forks
