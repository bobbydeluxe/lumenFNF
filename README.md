# fnf - lumen engine

a fork of p-slice engine [specifically p-slice 2.3.1] that attempts to be more modular and easier to script outside of songs with

why did i make this? i just thought p-slice was a bit too hardcoding-oriented, also i wanted it to have scripting capabilities akin to emi3's psych fork that let you script outside of songs, and also have a more modular structure that allows you to easily add new features without having to edit the engine itself

essentially a crossover between psych forks

## important notice:

this engine only works on windows, due to how the code is oriented. if you want to port it to other platforms, you will have to rewrite the code that handles the file system and the audio system, as well as the input system. if you want to do that, feel free to open a pull request.

or you can just use wine [i use windows so i can't test it on linux or macos]
