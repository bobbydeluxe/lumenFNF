put your custom health bar images here!

the images should be named as follows:
- outline.png - used for the outline of the health bar and anything you don't want to be colored by the icon colors
- background.png - typically should be all white, will be the part tinted by the icon colors

this allows for a better custom health bar system. ok bye lol. - bobbyDX
